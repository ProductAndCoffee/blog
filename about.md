Aspiring founder, product leader and builder - tugging at GTM funnels occasionally. 

I like building things that people pay for. I turn ambiguity into a plan, a plan into a product, and a product into growth. My comfort zone is early-stage chaos with a bias for clarity: make the call, ship the version, watch the data, talk to users, repeat.

GTM is part of the job. I’m interested in the full chain—from positioning and onboarding to activation, retention, expansion, and revenue. Product is the engine; GTM is the transmission.

Here you’ll find:
* Notes from building: discovery, MVPs, execution, iteration
* GTM thinking: messaging, launches, pricing, and adoption
* Templates: PRDs, scorecards, dashboards, workflows
* AI-native building: automations, agents, and guardrails

Build fast. Learn faster.
